# My Personal Landing Page

In order to better market myself as a web developer I've created a landing page that will serve as my portfolio. 

Right now it's still in the early stages as I don't actually have a portfolio, but I'm working on that.

## Installation

This is just an HTML file, a CSS file, and a handful of image files. No installation is required.

## Usage

This is just a page to look at- no further instructions needed.

## Contributing

Please contact me if you have any suggestions. Either things that need to be changed or removed, or elements that need to be added.

If you think it should be scrapped and started over from scratch you could suggest that too, but it wouldn't be very helpful without telling me exactly why it doesn't work.

## Current iteration

0.1  The html and CSS are present and mostly functional. Currently all project links are going to "www.google.com". More dedicated testing is needed.
